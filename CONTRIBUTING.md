# Contributing guidelines 

1. Start a new issue if you want to add a particular feature and clearly explain why you think it is needed. 
2. If adding lines of code, make sure to annotate your code appropriately. Make sure variable names are descriptive. 
3. Simply fixing typos in the README.md file will not be accepted as a valid PR
